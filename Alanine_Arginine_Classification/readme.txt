1. may3fulllinearrankedfiltered.csv : Preprocessed data after the application of data preprocessing techniques.
2. datasplit.ipynb, datapreprocessing.ipynb : codes containining stratified data split and one-hot encoding. Stratified data split in datasplit.ipynb creates trainsplitfinal.csv, valsplitfinal.csv, testsplitfinal.csv. One hot encoding in  datasplit.ipynb.ipynb creates finalXtrain.csv,finalXval.csv,finalXtest.csv,finalYtrain.csv.finalYval.csv.finalYtest.csv.
3. Decisionalaarg.ipynb, randomalaarg.ipynb, xgboostalaaarg.ipynb : Files containing codes for Decision Tree, Random Forest and Xgboost algorithms. The final model from Decisionalaarg.ipynb is saved as decisionnoweights.pickle, the final model from randomalaarg.ipynb is saved as randomnoweights.pickle, the final model from xgboostalaaarg.ipynb is saved as xgboostnoweights.pickle. 
4. ML_FORALAARG-works3_config.ipynb - This files contains codes for the Deep Learning model investigated and the best model is saved as alaarg_oct9_check_works3.h5.
